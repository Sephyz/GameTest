# GameTest

![Project Demo](demo/demo.gif)

I've never used Unreal Engine beforehand, so this is my attempt at seeing how far I could go in one day while looking up tutorials on how to use this engine.
I wish I could have done more before showing this, but I ran out of time and wasted way too much time doing stuff unrelated to coding (e.g. trying to make animations work).

Idea was just to control a fox and fight against other foxes. (All assets used were free on the Unreal marketplace)

The code I have written is in Source/GameTest

What is present:
- Input (Movement, jump, block camera rotation, attack) 
- Animations (Idle/Move/Jump/Block/Attack states)
- Health (Although it's not being used)



What's missing:
- Collision/Damage from attacking
- Audio
- AI for NPC foxes
- UI for Health
- Start game/Respawn/Kill count
